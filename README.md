# jotify.me

As a fan of [blank.page][1] and a certain [syllable counter][2], I wanted to have a hybrid of the two. This was the product. It's currently a work in progress.

jotify.me is a simple writing app and features multiple jots, or 'pages', word, line and syllable counters (currently not accurate), and a light/dark theme. 

Built with [React][3].

A few things on the to do list:
